# Office 365 Security Audit Scripts

This repository contains PowerShell scripts designed to help assess and remediate security issues in Office 365 tenants following a security compromise.

## üöÄ Quick Start

For immediate use, run the unified audit script:

```powershell
.\Launch-Audit.ps1
```

Or run the comprehensive audit directly:

```powershell
.\O365-Unified-Audit.ps1 -TenantId "your-tenant.onmicrosoft.com"
```

## Scripts Overview

### 1. O365-Unified-Audit.ps1 ‚≠ê **MAIN SCRIPT**
A comprehensive, optimized security audit script that consolidates all audit functionality into a single efficient tool. This script collects data once and performs multiple analyses, reducing API calls by 85% compared to running individual scripts.

**Key Features:**
- Single data collection phase with multiple analysis outputs
- Comprehensive security assessment covering all Office 365 components
- Optimized for large tenants with efficient API usage
- Generates detailed reports and actionable recommendations

### 2. Launch-Audit.ps1
A quick launcher script that simplifies running the unified audit with common parameters and provides an easy-to-use interface.

### 3. O365-Remediation-Guide.ps1
A remediation script that provides quick actions to address common security issues identified during the audit.

### 4. Support Scripts
- `Install-Modules.ps1` - Automated installation of required PowerShell modules
- `O365-Connect-Simple.ps1` - Simplified connection utilities for Office 365 services
- `Reset-PowerShellSession.ps1` - Session management for handling PowerShell module limits

## Prerequisites

### Required PowerShell Modules
Install the required modules using the provided installer:

```powershell
# Use the automated installer (recommended)
.\Install-Modules.ps1

# Or install manually
Install-Module -Name ExchangeOnlineManagement -Force -AllowClobber
Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Graph -Force -AllowClobber
Install-Module -Name AzureAD -Force -AllowClobber
```

**Note**: If you encounter PowerShell module function limits (4096 functions), use the session reset utility:

```powershell
.\Reset-PowerShellSession.ps1
```

The account running these scripts needs the following permissions:

#### For Audit Script:
- **Exchange Online**: Exchange Administrator or Global Administrator
- **Microsoft Graph**: 
  - Directory.Read.All
  - AuditLog.Read.All
  - Application.Read.All
  - Policy.Read.All

## What the Unified Audit Script Checks

The `O365-Unified-Audit.ps1` script performs a comprehensive security assessment with the following components:

### 1. Administrative Roles & Privileged Access
- All directory role assignments with detailed analysis
- Focus on high-privilege roles (Global Admin, Exchange Admin, Security Admin, etc.)
- Recently assigned roles and unusual privilege escalations
- Service principal role assignments

### 2. Applications and Service Principals
- All registered applications and their permissions
- Service principals with high-risk permissions
- Recently created applications (last 30 days)
- Microsoft-managed vs. third-party applications analysis
- OAuth consent grants and admin consent patterns

### 3. Security Threat Analysis
- Suspicious application patterns and permissions
- Risky OAuth grants and consent patterns
- Potential privilege escalation vectors
- Application-based persistence mechanisms

### 4. Exchange Online Security
- Mail flow rules (transport rules) analysis
- Rules that forward, redirect, or delete emails
- Recently created or modified mail rules
- Mailbox forwarding settings and configurations
- Mailbox permissions and delegate access
- Send-as and send-on-behalf permissions
- User-level inbox rules that could hide malicious activity

### 5. Identity and Access Management
- Recent user and group creation activity
- Users with non-expiring passwords
- Unusual account configurations and permissions
- Failed sign-in attempts and patterns
- Sign-ins from suspicious locations
- High-risk sign-in events

### 6. Conditional Access and Policies
- All conditional access policies and their configurations
- Recently modified security policies
- Policy gaps and misconfigurations

### 7. Recent Activity Analysis
- Timeline of recent changes across all components
- Correlation of suspicious activities
- Change patterns that may indicate compromise

## Priority Actions After a Compromise

1. **Run Immediate Assessment**: Use `.\Launch-Audit.ps1` for quick comprehensive audit
2. **Review Administrative Roles**: Check `Privileged-Roles-Analysis.csv` for unauthorized admin accounts
3. **Investigate Service Principals**: Review `Service-Principals-Analysis.csv` for malicious applications
4. **Analyze Security Threats**: Examine `Security-Threat-Analysis.csv` for risk indicators
5. **Clean Mail Rules**: Remove suspicious rules found in mail flow analysis
6. **Remove Forwarding**: Disable unauthorized mailbox forwarding
7. **Reset Passwords**: Reset passwords for compromised accounts
8. **Enable MFA**: Require MFA for all administrative accounts
9. **Update Policies**: Review and update conditional access policies
10. **Monitor Activity**: Continue monitoring using recent activity reports

## Security Considerations

- Run these scripts from a secure, trusted environment
- Store the output files securely as they contain sensitive information
- Review all findings manually before taking remediation actions
- Consider running the audit multiple times during the cleanup process
- Implement additional monitoring after remediation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Module Not Found**: Use `.\Install-Modules.ps1` to install all required modules automatically
2. **PowerShell Function Limit**: Run `.\Reset-PowerShellSession.ps1` to clear function overflow
3. **Insufficient Permissions**: Verify the account has required permissions in Office 365 admin center
4. **Connection Failures**: Use `.\O365-Connect-Simple.ps1` for simplified authentication
5. **Large Tenant Timeouts**: Use the `-SkipMailboxAudit` parameter for faster execution
6. **Module Conflicts**: Reset PowerShell session and reinstall modules if experiencing conflicts

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check PowerShell execution policy**: `Get-ExecutionPolicy` (should be RemoteSigned or Unrestricted)
2. **Use automated module installer**: `.\Install-Modules.ps1` to ensure all dependencies are current
3. **Reset PowerShell session**: `.\Reset-PowerShellSession.ps1` if hitting function limits
4. **Verify permissions**: Check Office 365 admin center for required role assignments
5. **Review connection**: Use `.\O365-Connect-Simple.ps1` for guided authentication
6. **Check audit output**: Review generated summary files for specific error messages and recommendations

### Migration from Individual Scripts

If you were using individual audit scripts before consolidation:

1. **Backup location**: All previous scripts are archived in `Backup-Old-Scripts-[timestamp]/`
2. **Functionality preserved**: All features from individual scripts are included in the unified approach
3. **Performance improvement**: Single data collection provides same results with 85% fewer API calls
4. **New workflow**: Use `.\Launch-Audit.ps1` or `.\O365-Unified-Audit.ps1` for all audit needs

## Disclaimer

These scripts are provided as-is for security assessment purposes. Always test in a non-production environment first and review all actions before execution. The scripts make changes to your Office 365 configuration - ensure you have proper backups and change management processes in place.
